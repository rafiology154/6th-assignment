### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Ans: var: This is an old JavaScript variable that can be declared with the same name. 
if used before the declaration, it becomes an undefined value, which is now prohibited from use. 

let: This is a modern JavaScript variable whose value we can change if we want, but if used before the declaration, it gives an error. 

Const: We declare immutable variables with this.



 ### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
Ans: map (): Returns a new array by running a function on each element without changing the original array 

      forEach(): Works like a loop but does not return any array 

      filter(): Returns a new array according to the condition. Does not change the original array.

### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Ans: Arrow functions: Which are written with this symbol (=>). It is most used to write small functions. It does not need to use return separately.


### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Ans: Destructuring: In this way we can declare values from objects or arrays as variables.


### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Ans: Template literals: These are basically written with backticks (``), which can be used to write directly on multiple lines.
